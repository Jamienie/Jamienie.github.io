<p style="color:blue;"> What is a list? .</p>

We all know what a list is. We probably make lists everyday -  grocery shopping list, to do list, emails, song playlists, etc. I cannot imagine going into a grocery store without a shopping list.  I would scratch my head standing in front aisles of products without a list. Lists are fundamental on our daily life.

<p style="color:red;"> So what is a list in Python? .</p>

Just like a shopping list, a list in Python is a grouping of comma-separated items between square brackets `[]`. Now let us create a grocery shopping list.

Creating a list just is as simple as putting items in square brackets. Let us create more lists.

The list is a very flexible datatype available in Python. When we print out the list (see number_list), the output looks exactly like the list we created. So lists in Python are ordered. Now letâ€™s give a Python list a better definition: A list is an ordered sequence of items.
