title: Intruction to Lists in Python
---

What is a list?  
We all know what a list is. We probably make lists everyday -  grocery shopping list, to do list, emails, song playlists, etc. I cannot imagine going into a grocery store without a shopping list.  I would starch my head standing in front aisles of products without a list. Lists are fundamental on our daily life.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [shopping list](https://www.flyintotheworld.com/dr-oz-10-day-belly-slimdown-plan-alcohol-salty-food/dr-oz-10-day-belly-slimdown-plan-alcohol-salty-food-1/) on GitHub.
