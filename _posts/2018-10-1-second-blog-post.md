Why should you get life insurance?

What is life insurance? Let’s say, someone purchases a contract from an insurance company, and in return, upon the death of this person, the insurance company will deliver a cheque (a lump sum payment - death benefit) to his/her family, and the contract ends.

Why should you buy life insurance? What life insurance can do for you and for your family? To answer these questions, I will analyze two main types of life insurance in Canada: term insurance and permanent life insurance. For each type, I pick one common product to compare. The products I pick (term 20 and whole life) are from Equitable Life, which is one of the top 10 insurance companies in Canada.

Term 20 life insurance, which is in the category of Term life insurance
Term 20 life insurance provides death benefit at a rate of payment which is changed very 20 years until the insurance contract ends or the person insured dies, whichever occurs first. If the life insured dies during the term, the death benefit will be paid to the the person's family.

Whole Life insurance, which is in the category of Permanent life insurance
Whole life insurance is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the life insured’s entire lifetime as long as the required payments are paid. The rate of payments is fixed for the entire lifetime.

Let us build a sample case for the purpose of analyzing these 2 life insurance products: Joe is a healthy, non-smoking 30 years old man, who is happily married with two beautiful children. Joe is looking for a life insurance with death benefit of $500,000, which means his family will receive a cheque of $500,000 from the insurance company upon his death given he has not missed any insurance payment to the insurance company.

1. How much does life insurance cost?
Like purchasing any product from grocery store, the first thing Joe would like to know is the price. Life insurance is not free. Insurance company will issue the death benefit (a.k.a. the cheque) to his family (spouse, children,etc.) only if he keeps paying to the company while he is alive or in a certain number of years. The good news is that he can choose to pay the payment monthly or annually.
