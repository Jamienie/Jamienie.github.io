title: Why should you get life insurance?
---

What is life insurance? Let’s say, someone purchases a contract from an insurance company, and in return, upon the death of this person, the insurance company will deliver a cheque (a lump sum payment - death benefit) to his/her family, and the contract ends.

Why should you buy life insurance? What life insurance can do for you and for your family? To answer these questions, I will analyze two main types of life insurance in Canada: term insurance and permanent life insurance. For each type, I pick one common product to compare. The products I pick (term 20 and whole life) are from Equitable Life, which is one of the top 10 insurance companies in Canada.

Term 20 life insurance, which is in the category of Term life insurance
Term 20 life insurance provides death benefit at a rate of payment which is changed very 20 years until the insurance contract ends or the person insured dies, whichever occurs first. If the life insured dies during the term, the death benefit will be paid to the the person's family.

Whole Life insurance, which is in the category of Permanent life insurance
Whole life insurance is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the life insured’s entire lifetime as long as the required payments are paid. The rate of payments is fixed for the entire lifetime.

Let us build a sample case for the purpose of analyzing these 2 life insurance products: Joe is a healthy, non-smoking 30 years old man, who is happily married with two beautiful children. Joe is looking for a life insurance with death benefit of $500,000, which means his family will receive a cheque of $500,000 from the insurance company upon his death given he has not missed any insurance payment to the insurance company.

### 1. How much does life insurance cost?
Like purchasing any product from grocery store, the first thing Joe would like to know is the price. Life insurance is not free. Insurance company will issue the death benefit (a.k.a. the cheque) to his family (spouse, children,etc.) only if he keeps paying to the company while he is alive or in a certain number of years. The good news is that he can choose to pay the payment monthly or annually.

Joe is surprised to see such a big difference between Term 20 and Whole Life. And he wants to know why. It is because the cost of Term 20 starts at a very low rate, and then it increases every 20 years. The overall cost of Term 20 life insurance is higher.

### 2. How long does life insurance cover for?

The Term 20 life insurance remains in force till Joe reaches age 85 or upon his death before age 85. What will happen if he lives beyond age 85? The term 20 life insurance contract will end when he reaches age 85 and he is not covered by this insurance any longer.
However, whole life insurance is guaranteed to remain in force for Joe’s entire lifetime, no matter at what age he dies.

### 3. What life insurance can do?
Once the cheque of death benefit is given to Joe’s family, there is no more connection between Joe’s family and the insurance company. Joe’s family can spend the money in any way they want. I have listed the most common reasons to buy life insurance.

### 4. Can Joe cancel his life insurance before it expires?
The answer is yes. He can cancel his life insurance any time before the insurance expires with no penalty nor extra charges. There is a difference between Term 20 and Whole Life in terms of insurance cancellation. Term 20 life insurance and all other term life insurance policies do not have cash value, while whole life insurances do have cash value. What is cash value? Whole life insurance policies require fixed level payments, of which a portion is allocated to the cost of insurance itself and the remaining deposited into a cash value account. The cash value account earns interest. The cash value is offered to Joe upon the cancellation of his insurance policy. Cash value is not offered to Joe upon his death; only the death benefit of $500,000 is offered to Joe’s family upon his death.

## Conclusion

Life insurance is designed to protect your family who depends on you for financial support. The day that you die, your income stops. But your family will still have to pay for your mortgage, groceries, your children’s education, your funeral and even your income tax in the year of your death. Life insurance will deliver a cheque of death benefit upon your death, which can help your family survive financially after you are gone. If you want to provide for your family financially even after you die, think about getting life insurance.
