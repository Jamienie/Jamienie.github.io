I am currently studying Master of Data Science at University of British Columbia. I have previously completed a Bachelor of Science, with a major in Actuarial Science, at University of Regina.  I have always had a passion for data and analytics. I believe that data science can be applied to many different domains; data and analytics can have a real influence on the decisions businesses take and how they are implemented.
